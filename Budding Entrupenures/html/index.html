         suffer losses and become less prevalent in the markets. Age is truly no bar for these young Indian
         entrepreneurs who have set out to break stereotypes and carve out a unique niche for themselves.

        <summary>Future of Entrepreneurship in India</summary>
        <p class="summary" style="margin-left: 2px;">In India, business was traditionally considered to be the domain of scholarly challenged
           individuals or the result of natural inheritance within business communities. Gradually, the
           appetite for risk and the acceptance of failure increased, but only recently have alternate professions
           and the idea of "following one’s dream" gained approval. In particular, entrepreneurship caught
           the fancy of the Indian middle class after the economy was liberalized. The economic reforms introduced
           in 1991 reduced the bureaucratic controls, promoted private enterprise, and lowered the barriers to
           creating new businesses.Coupled with the emergence of knowledge economy, the demand for skilled employees
           greatly increased and a trend emerged toward technology entrepreneurship in the services sector, which is
           less capital-intensive than traditional industries.</p>
        <p class="summary" style="margin-left: 2px;">Indeed, the future of entrepreneurship in India lies in the services sector, and the Government of
           India is providing support to encourage this trend. However, there are as many challenges as there
           are opportunities.
